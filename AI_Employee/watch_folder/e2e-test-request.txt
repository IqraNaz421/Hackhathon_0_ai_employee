Subject: Verify complete workflow from detection to plan creation
From: Testing Team
Date: 2026-01-09
Priority: High

Description:
This is a test action item to verify the complete end-to-end workflow of the Bronze Tier Personal AI Employee system. This test should trigger the following sequence:

1. Filesystem watcher detects this new file
2. Watcher creates an action item in /Needs_Action/
3. Dashboard.md is updated to show the new pending item
4. Claude Code processes the action item using the @process-action-items skill
5. A structured plan is created in /Plans/ with actionable checkboxes
6. The original action item is moved to /Done/
7. Dashboard.md is updated to reflect the completed processing

Expected Outcome:
- Action item file created in /Needs_Action/ within 60 seconds
- Plan file created in /Plans/ with minimum 3 checkboxes
- Original action item moved to /Done/
- Dashboard shows accurate counts and recent activity
- No duplicate files created
- All error handling works correctly

Test Categories:
- Watcher detection capability
- File creation and frontmatter formatting
- Claude Code integration via Agent Skill
- Vault folder transitions (Needs_Action → Done)
- Dashboard synchronization
- Duplicate prevention mechanism

URGENT: Live E2E Test - Watcher Running

Subject: Test action item created while watcher is active
From: E2E Test Suite
Date: 2026-01-09 16:30:00
Priority: High

This file is being created while the watcher is actively running to test real-time detection.

Expected behavior:
1. Watcher detects this file immediately (within 5 seconds based on CHECK_INTERVAL)
2. Creates action item in /Needs_Action/ with proper frontmatter
3. Updates Dashboard.md to show pending item count
4. Prevents duplicate processing if file is encountered again

Test verification points:
- Action item contains this content
- Frontmatter includes source, priority, timestamp
- File is tracked in .processed_ids.json
- Dashboard reflects accurate state
